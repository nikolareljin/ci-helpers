Changelog

This project uses Keep a Changelog style and aims to follow Semantic Versioning for tagged releases.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-01-11

- Added: Cross-distro packaging scaffolds (Debian, RPM, Arch, Homebrew) with shared metadata templates.
- Added: Packaging helper module and scripts to render templates and build RPM/Arch artifacts.
- Added: Packaging docs covering structure, build commands, signing notes, and install commands.
- Changed: Tag existence checks now verify exact refs to avoid false matches (e.g., `0.10.0` vs `0.1.0`).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-08

- Added: `lib/package_publish.sh` for shared Debian/PPA publishing helpers.
- Added: package publish example script.
- Changed: packaging scripts now use shared helpers via `shlib_import`.
- Changed: download dialog gauge uses fixed sizing and no-shadow to avoid visual artifacts.

- Added: Debian packaging helpers (`scripts/build_deb_artifacts.sh`, `scripts/ppa_upload.sh`).

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-26

- Changed: Unified script help rendering across `display_help`, `print_help`, and `show_help` with a shared renderer.
- Changed: `-h/--help` now prefers script-level header help when the caller script is known.
- Fixed: Header parsing now only reads the top comment block and captures parameter lines reliably without pulling unrelated script comments.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-20

- Added: `version` module (`version_bump`, `version_compare`) with support for optional version file paths and preserving prefixes/suffixes.
- Changed: `scripts/bump_version.sh` now delegates to `version_bump` and accepts `-f/--file`.
- Changed: `version_compare` now returns -1/0/1 (surfaced as 255/0/1 in shells) and keeps higher codes for errors (2 missing args, 3 invalid format).
- Docs: Added module docs and usage examples for version helpers.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-16

- Changed: Docker checks now distinguish missing CLI, stopped daemon, and permission errors for clearer guidance (2025-12-16).

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-16

- Changed: `init_include` now finds the caller project root reliably and keeps debug logging safe under `set -e` (2025-12-16).

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-27

- Added: `docker_status` in `lib/docker.sh` to show running containers and cross-check services from the current directory's `docker-compose.yml`, marking statuses with glyphs (✅ running, 💥 failed, ✖️ not running). Includes example `scripts/example_docker_status.sh` and updates to README/Makefile (2025-11-27).
- Changed: Tweak download notification messages for clarity in the dialog gauge (2025-11-05).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-03

- Added: Dialog-based download progress gauge via `dialog_download_file`, showing percent, size, speed, and ETA. Integrated into `file.sh::download_file` with automatic fallback to `curl`/`wget` when needed (2025-11-03).
- Added: Example scripts for downloads, dialog input, logging, env, Docker Compose, and JSON helpers; `make examples` target to run demos (2025-11-03).
- Changed: On download failures, display a `dialog` error with exit code and recent output before falling back to non-interactive download (2025-11-03).
- Docs: Expanded README with usage, compatibility notes, and `DOWNLOAD_USE_DIALOG` behavior (2025-11-03).

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-22

- Added: Ollama helpers (`lib/ollama.sh`) and model installer script (`scripts/install_ollama_model.sh`) to install and manage models via dialog selection or CLI (2025-10-18).
- Added: `CHANGELOG.md` to document notable changes (2025-10-17).

- Changed: README install instructions and guidance for using this repo as a Git submodule (2025-10-18, 2025-10-22).
- Maintenance: Purged `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` from history; updated version metadata (2025-10-17, 2025-10-22).
- Docs: Unified script help headers across `scripts/*` for consistent usage output (2025-10-22).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-17
