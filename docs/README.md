# Documentation

This directory contains detailed guidance for using and extending the reusable
workflows and composite actions in this repository.

Start here:
- [Reusable workflows](workflows.md) for CI/PR gate/deploy workflow inputs, ordering, and examples.
- [Presets](presets.md) for stack-specific and E2E presets (Node/React/Playwright/Cypress).
- [Composite actions](actions.md) for semver compare and release tag guard.
- [Examples](examples.md) for common usage patterns (monorepos, E2E servers, Docker + E2E).
